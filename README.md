## 📜 Project Overview

Infinity2Chrome is a tool designed to help you securely transfer your bookmarks from the Infinity new tab page to the Chrome browser. After using Infinity for nearly seven years, we discovered potential security issues. This tool allows users to migrate their bookmark data safely to Chrome's native bookmarks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with Infinity2Chrome, follow these simple steps:

1. **Export Backup File**: First, you need to export your backup file from the Infinity extension. This will be in `.infinity` format.
  
2. **Visit Infinity2Chrome Website**: Go to the [Infinity2Chrome Releases Page](https://github.com/Wunderknabe1/Infinity2Chrome/releases) to download the tool.

3. **Upload Backup File**: Upload your exported `.infinity` file on the Infinity2Chrome website.

4. **Click Export Button**: Click the "Export to Chrome Bookmarks" button to generate the HTML file.

5. **Import to Chrome**: Open the Chrome Bookmark Manager and import the generated HTML file. Your bookmarks will now appear in Chrome.

## 💡 Features

- **Import Support**: Import `.infinity` and `.json` format backup files.
- **Bookmark Display**: Parse and display all bookmark data for your review.
- **Export Capability**: Export bookmarks in standard Chrome bookmarks HTML format.
